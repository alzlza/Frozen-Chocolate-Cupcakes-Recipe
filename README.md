   <h1> <strong> The Ingredients that you'll need are: </strong> </h1>
      <ul>
        <li> 1/2 a cup of Powdered Sugar </li>
        <li> Around 8 Hershey's chocolate bars </li>
        <li> Brownies (any kind) </li>
        <li> 1 & 1/2 cup of Peanut butter (preferably the creamy, smooth kind) </li>
        <li> Cupcake wrappers + pan </li>
      </ul> 
   <h2> <strong> STEPS </strong> </h2>
  <ul> 
        <li> <strong> Bake your brownies, the ingrredients tend to be on the boxed versions. ,i> DO NOT START ON CUPCAKES TILL YOUR BROWNIES ARE COMPLETELY COOL. </i> </strong> </li>
        <li> <strong> Mix the powdered sugar and peanut butter together to create a less sticky consistency. This will make it easier to stay in the cupcake, while also decreasing the strong taste of the peanut butter </strong> </li>
        <li> <strong> Melt your chocolate into a big bowl </strong> </li>
        <li> <strong> Get out your cupcake wrappers and set them out into your cupcake pan </strong> </li>
        <li> <strong> Now that all your ingredients are ready, you layer them in the cupcake wrapper! First, a small layer of chocolate, then a spoonful of brownie. What I tend to do is roll the brownie into a ball, then flatten, so it creates a nice even layer. After layering the brownie atop the chocolate, add in your peanut butter. The amount varies with how much you enjoy peanut butter, and it is important to keep in mind that peanut butter has a strong flavor. I don't have exact measurements for how much I put, but usually a generous amount, since there's <i> a lot </i> of chocolate. Once you finish with the peanut butter, you top off your cupcake with a nice layer of your chocolate, and then pop them in the freezer. These freeze in usually thirty minutes, and then they are ready to enjoy! </strong> </li>
